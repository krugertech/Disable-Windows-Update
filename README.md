# About
This window service will monitors Windows Update every few seconds to ensure it is stopped and disabled. 

# Control back into your hands
Windows 10 forces you to continually update even when you disable the Windows Update service.
Often Win10 updates fail leaving computers in a broken state requiring several man hours to repair. This application allows you to turn off the updates until you decide to go ahead with them.

# Download
 [Windows Installer](https://github.com/krugertech/Disable-Windows-Update/tree/master/Binaries)

# How will this impact me?
This service will constantly disable Windows Update from the moment you install it. 
This means that Updates will not be downloaded or installed on your computer.
Included is a small control application allowing you to temporarily turn Updates back on for when you need to perform updates or download content from the Microsoft Store.
