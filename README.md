# About
This window service will monitors Windows Update every few seconds to ensure it is stopped and disabled. 

# Control back into your hands
Windows 10 forces you to continually update even when you disable the Windows Update service.
Often Win10 updates fail leaving computers in a broken state requiring several man hours to repair. This application allows you to turn off the updates until you decide to go ahead with them.

# How will this impact me?
This service will constantly disable Windows Update from the moment you install or boot your computer. 
This means that Updates will not be installed and that other Windows Features such as the Microsoft Store will have limited usability.
Included is a small control application for permananetly turning Updates back on and permanently turning them off.
